Working title:
Post DX: Robotic Rejuvenation

The years is AD 2144. 

A deadly airborne pathogen called DX was released upon the earth and the world’s population has been reduced to five percent of its peak of 16 billion in 2104. 

Before the epidemic struck, the world’s environment was on the edge of total collapse and nearly all remaining resources were close to being depleted. Our attempts of becoming an interplanetary species had all failed due to the lack of common effort and investments towards it. The earth’s sustainable population was long exceeded and survival of the fittest was once again as relevant for humans as for any other species throughout history. The weak were being exploited and prayed upon by those with the resources to do so. Private military organizations rose from the desperation and seized power where they could. Humanity was being shown from its most brutal and detrimental side.

All this is what motivated the secret terror organization Infernal Rebirth (I.R.) to develop and deploy
the extremely infectious virus which was carried by close to the entire population within weeks. The visible symptoms of DX were delayed to the point where it was too late to start working on a cure when it was discovered. Society collapsed into unparalleled mass death and decay.

The survival of human kind now rests upon the shoulders of a few remaining but heavily damaged groups struggling to persist, and better yet, rebuild society as we once knew it. Robotic technology developed in the 2080s is the corner stone of their efforts. The humans reside underground in old strictly controlled cities built by military organizations in case of apocalyptic events, which are free of the virus. No-one may leave the safe havens and this is being ensured by robotic AI deployed by the guardians of the cities. 
All harvesting and transportation of resources from the surface is being carried out by automated robots utilizing advanced sensors and modules developed long before the epidemic. As the requirements for the robots carrying out these tasks on behalf of the humans constantly change due to the availability of the resources most needed, new AI most be programmed into the memory of the bots to keep resources coming in.

All remaining engineering efforts which humanity can afford are being directed towards building new robots and maintaining the existing. In order to succeed in rebuilding society the robotic technology must be further developed and robots with even more advanced capabilities will be needed shortly.

The common dream of all humans is to one day be able to return to the surface of the earth and enjoy the planet once more.
